    "transcript": "they told that woman should not expose themselves in front of men their beauty should only be seen\nby their husbands otherwise allah will punish them they interpreted islam to me in such a way that i\ncould i i should con i should and um think in a in that way that is how they were uh interpreting\nthis this should be the final decision this is the ultimate truth islam is the ultimate truth and\nallah is the only one god to be worshipped and i should follow strictly what muhammad done in his\nlifetime and what what the muslim woman should do in in her lifetime that i should do namaste\nreligious conversions are not new to india people have converted from sanatana dharma to other\nfaiths for a multitude of reasons may be monetary sometimes due to lack of answers in their own\nfaith uh and sometimes due to coercion in today's interview we'll talk to three lovely women who\nhave traveled the full circle to understand their journey through other faiths and back to sanatan\ndharma they are all a part of aarsha vidya samajam an organization based in tirunanthapuram with a\nvery important mission of educating people about sanatana dharma our first guest is shruti she is\nthe first woman pracharika at asha vidya samajam dedicating her life to the mission of taking\nsanatana dharma to the world she returned to sanatana dharma eight years ago through

physiotherapist by\nprofession and leads the creative team at our samajan coming from a very conservative hindu family\nanika converted to islam going to a void that is common in hindu dharma and the way it is practiced\ntoday having practiced islam for six years she came back to sanatana dharma through our shamatha our\nthird guest today is vishali shetty she was once an agnostic and she turned into an islamic\nsympathizer and she returned to sanatan dharma through aarsviya samajan having been convinced of the\nmagnitude of the mission that the samajam has undertaken she chose to be a sanatan dharma pacharika\nwith abs with her prior experience in it she drives the technical and marketing activities at abs\nshruti anagha and vishali very very warm welcome thank you so much for joining us thank you deepti\nso shruti and anika will start with you how did your conversion out of sanatan dharma happen first\nof all uh i would like to thank infinity uh to giving such an opportunity to speak in front of the\nlarge audience uh to speak about my experience to speak about mother my mother organization thank\nyou again and the question was question is how how the experience happened in my life and how i\ncould come back uh yeah i i was born in a brahmin family having brahmin family in castro district of\nkerala since childhood as i i won in the brahmin family i underwent different different rituals lots\nof rituals i uh i had to i could see but i could attend but i was uh unaware about its scientific\nreasons scientific things behind the rituals ceremonies everything since childhood itself i heard a\nquestioning minding me and i used to ask elder people what is the uh science behind it what is story\nbehind all these rituals all these ceremonies which we are conducting here in our home or in temples\nor in any other relatives home center but uh unfortunately as uh brahmin caste is full of\nrestrictions towards the women why i don't know uh why people are restricting such things from women\nah i had to experience such restrictions my father was saying no no women are not have the right to\na question like this uh whatever things is uh practicing from our ancestors whatever our ancestors\nare were doing that we we are doing also and we are not supposed to question that what uh we have to\nfollow that only that was uh i was getting answer that time and uh later on when my parents or i i\nwon't i won't blame blame my parents because they don't know uh what the thing is uh because their\nelders didn't teach them so they they they also in same situation what i'm experiencing so i i have\nno right to blame them so this was happening so my parents and the elders were uh are in the opinion\nthat uh ladies or women are not supposed to question or women are not supposed to learn vedas or\nthey are not supposed to pronounce where the mantras like that so later on i got a fear in my mind\nto ask questions because these restrictions uh these objections everything and scalding also i was\ngetting so i stopped asking the questions kept in my mind unanswered and uh later dude when i was\nwatching uh omna shivaya and like television serials were don't know i i was knowing about something\nabout hinduism just only through these television serials only the concept of god or anything like\nthat i was knowing just because of this television series so when i was watching those series i was\ni used to ask why uh parvati devi and all other goddesses are called as mother why shri paramishra\nis not called as father he is called just like prabhu why it is so so i got an answer from my elders\nthat in hinduism we can call any woman mother but we can't call any uh male or any gentleman as\nfather we can call only one person as father uh that is what i that is the conservative thought i\ngot uh i got as answer so i couldn't continue the questioning and all those those questions kept in\nmy mind and time went uh i um i stopped asking everything these questions were in my mind and i was\nexperiencing causticism somewhere in my family and my my father was a little bit uh cast conscious\nand uh i heard i draw i grew up hearing we are brahmins and we are not like we are hindus i never\nheard such a word in anywhere i i came to know about this in the name hindu only when i fill up with\nany uh school or any uh application forms we can feel that uh what is your religion the question we\nwill fill hindu then only i'll use that name i didn't i never heard such a word in my life till i\ncome to uh so likewise time went during my graduation period unfortunately uh in my ba literature\nclass the english literature class there was full of muslim classmates i had that muslim girlfriends\nokay so from them i got this islamic influence and they taught me what is islam by the very first i\nhadn't any notion about the conversion and all but uh they used to ask my con my about my religion\nabout the concept of god in my religion they used to ask why you people are having these much of\ngods and why you are worshiping a monkey god why you are worshiping elephant head god likewise lots\nof questions they asked uh as i am ign ignorant about all these things i couldn't answer properly so\nuh it generated a type of inferiority complex in me and anyhow i try to ignore ignore their\nquestions ignore them but i could ignore only people the questions which uh all they asked uh were\nin my mind so the questions i had since childhood again came to my mind and it it began to haunt me\nuh gradually i i i could i was thinking that i am not getting any answer for all these questions i\nam not able to answer for all these questions so um there is no system in my good system in my\nmother religion there is no facility to know all these things so this is our simply based likewise i\nwas thinking they made me think like that by interpreting different inter interpreting in a wrong\nway about hinduism and they began to teach their religion they began to give me pamphlets books\nseries of speeches of this religion regarding or islamic religion topics like that time went the\nstudies went on and i was thinking that islam is the uh ultimate truth and my ques my quest to know\nabout truth is going to fulfill by learning about islam likewise i was feeling that time because\nalready they uh understood me my concepts my viewpoints regarding that i i hadn't uh i was not a\nperson uh believing in lots of uh so many goals i was believing in a single god uh i never uh i\nnever felt that in its uh that single god's name is allah or any other name but i i was uh in such a\nview that there is only one god and other my uh my my viewpoint on women was very high that uh women\nare not supposed to suppress women are not supposed to downtrodden they they should they should get\nequal status uh in society with men they should get equal status uh the atrocities everything is\nhappening towards women i i was against to those all things so they interpreted islam to me in such\na way that i could i i should con i should [Music] think in that way that is how they were uh inter\ninterpreting that was similar to similar to my viewpoints that is how they interpreted so finally i\nthought this is the final uh this this should be the final decision this is the ultimate truth islam\nis the ultimate truth and allah is the only one god to be worshipped and i should follow strictly\nwhat muhammad done in his lifetime and what what the muslim woman should do in in her lifetime that\ni should do and i should be the very uh perfect believer uh very perfect follower of islam uh\nlikewise i was thinking my brain went like that my i my thoughts uh changed to in that way so i\nbegan to do namas i began to practice rose i began to do rosa likewise it went on later i came to\nknow from my friends and colleagues i i was teacher also after prost in pasteurization i i was\nteaching in uh for into three muslim management schools from the students and colleagues helped me\nto learn about islam and my from my colleagues and uh some from some students and from my friend a\nfew muslim friends and from some texts i came to know that uh if my namas and rosa should be\naccepted uh i should accept islam legally so i decided to uh go out from my home and i done the same\ni went out from my home uh lying in my home with my parents and i joined in panani manutel islam\nsabha eight years back and it is in malapram district it is also called as mini mecca and i went\nunderwent two months course the islamic course from there also i was getting i was getting teachings\nwhich is against our country they were teaching me like not only to me but the all students who were\nundergoing that islamic course they were teaching like this is not our country this is the country\nof hindu people here hindu hindus are only residing our countries uh saudi arabia were where\nmuhammad prophet muhammad born and brought up we uh we are supposed to live there then only we can\nlive perfect as a perfect muslim woman likewise they were teaching so i was during that time i was\nthinking that i have to go out from india i have to go saudi arabia countries uh and i have to\npreach islam till my last breathe i have to convert my parents my entire family likewise my mission\nwas that time i decided to live like that so to for islam i i i was ready to do anything if i have\nto kill a person for islam if i have to kill a person if he is against islam i am i was ready that\nwas that much my brain was that much brainwashing was happened towards me and during that time my\nparents put a missing complaint in my native place and with the help of uh police and some native\npeople uh they could identify me that i i i'm learning islam there in pannani so with the help of\npolice that uh brought me back from there and uh in front of in court also in front of magistrate i\nthought i have to go back to panani i have to live like a woman i have to learn islam more and all\nmy parents should come likewise i was saying but my parents situation was very pathetic if i didn't\nsay that for just for two days i will go with my parents my parents would have died that moment\nitself there was a bottle in my father's hand during i was speaking with the magistrate that bottle\nwas poison bottle so if i if i said something against that that i i now itself i have to go to\npunani again my father would have drunk that person and i would have lost my parents that moment\nitself so maybe because of the uh the good deeds done in my uh earlier birth i could say that for\njust for two days i will go with my parents that two days changed my life they took me to uh an\nastrologist from uh from him they got an advice that make her vomit and some drinks they gave me\nsome medicinal drinks i drunk i vomited but the con the ideologies which is uh what influenced my\nmind kept on there itself something by what i ate at the morning time that went out that much only\nthey thought that some black magic happened on me uh to the viewers and to the all eyes i would like\nto say what is learned is when learned will be kept itself in our brain vomiting will not uh be a\nsolution for that and please don't take someone to any astrologist or any uh such ayurvedic\ntreatment like that if someone is caught under custody of any islamic preachers like that okay and\nafter that my parents with the help of some hindu organizations uh while i was coming to ashradyas\nsome people who who are bringing me to here were very um in a very a lot lots of things they were\nspeaking they were saying that ah is an institution there all people are changing and um there is\nthen uh there is an azaria there like that he is a great personality he could bring that lot of\npeople uh he could change lots of people's life and he have such power and likewise they were\ninterpreting him they were explaining about him describing about him then i decided i i should meet\nhim who is that person i should meet him and i would like i would be great if i could change uh the\nuh that person himself to islam that is what i felt that time so i was waiting to meet acharya\nmanoji uh to convert him to islam at that time unfortunately but now i feel fortunately i met him\nand i told him don't call me i very arrogantly i behaved towards you know manoji and our guruji i\ntold don't call me as shruti call me like rahmat it is my name and i accepted islam and i i would\nlike to speak with you only based on quran only i don't want to listen to your vedas and all this\nall the all these things are not my religious textbook all these things are haram to me i don't want\nto listen about that i would like to speak about uh quran only that is what i said that time with\nthe very not like this but very arrogantly very patiently very calmly he smilingly he told okay uh\nif you would like to call you like if if you would like uh call you like rahmat i'm ready to call\nyou a call rahmat no problem uh name doesn't matter please with the patience you listen and you\nspeak and as a human being you think not like a blind believer of islam or blind follower of islam\nnot like a blind criticizer of islam not like in that state you just as a human being listen and\nspeak show the patience to listen and show the patience to speak likewise he advised me that time\nagain uh ishvara's hands began to work behind from behind me i think and i could listen to him and\nhe never advised me never taught me anything he just made me read quran again as a human being that\nwas that much he done that time he told me uh each verses from quran he showed and told me just read\nit just read it as a human being and use your intellect and use your reasoning power and compare\nwith uh the concept of god as a human being you might you may be having a concept of god and compare\nit with that that moment i was feeling that the i was i was having a concept earlier my friends and\ncolleagues everyone were interpreting or concept regarding islam ideology ideologies regarding islam\neverything similar to my concept but what is written in the religious text like quran is entirely\ndifferent woman i i was having a respect to respect towards women and the woman is uh pictured in a\ndifferent way in a in a what i what is what i say in a downtrodden way my memory is correct in\nchapter 2 223 is the women are compared to uh agricultural land how pathetic it is i was feeling and\nmy my ego was not agreeing to not allowing me to agree what acharya is saying i tried to argue with\nhim but uh he again showed patience okay leave about that verse like let us see about the what is\nfurther written in that so one by one verses he made me read and i could realize what wrong i did\nduring my islamic belief and all was i i got influenced to islam i done a lot of uh bad deeds\ntowards hinduism i used to speak in temple courtyard when my parents told compelled me to go to\ntemple i went to temple without any uh without any uh what i say any believe or any uh any affection\ntowards temple or any affection towards hinduism i stood in front of shiva linga thinking that it is\nnot a idol it is just a stone or it is symbol to uh male genital uh part likewise i was thinking\nthey interpreted like that no so i was thinking that like that i scolded once my mother i beaten my\nmother once just because she is coffer and i don't want to eat food from kafir's hand she compelled\nme to eat that too she prepared with love and care what is i like what is my favorite food that is\nshe prepared and with love and care she gave me i i opposed it and i beaten her also and when she\ncompared me to pray i argued with her i screamed with her i shouted with her lots of things happened\nduring that time when islamic beliefs was uh undergoing that that time during that time later when i\nrealized that all these things i did just for this fake uh inhuman religion it was very uh pathetic\nmy situation that time if i say the uh only because of my our guruji come back to life just for a\nmoment i thought to suicide also if i went to my home into my native place that time i would have\ndone suicide at least or else i would have already i am a sinful person now so why should i live\nwith a good people or in a good religion i should live a sinful life ahead that that much my mind uh\ndisturbed and mentally i was that much uh in in such a situation so that moment our guruji and other\nteachers in our videos uh and ash vidya samaj mandi's courses here everything helped me to come back\nto uh sanatana dharma and the hard work uh our guruji and all other teachers are doing made me uh to\nthink why should i uh put my steps backward i should move from more ahead i why should i change my\ndecision of preaching truth to the people i realized what is truth this is the ultimate truth that\nis sanatana dharma the everlasting uh dharma which is given by lord sri paramishra and through rishi\nparamparas why should i uh think that as or usually all people think i got rescued and i should live\nwith my parents why should i think like that i should come forward because there are lots of women\nlots of people are uh day by day uh converting to such really such fake religions why should i allow\nthem they are all my parents all my sisters and brothers they are all my family members why should i\nlearn vasudeva if i am not ready to practice that why should i learn why should i uh why did i learn\nlokas if i'm not ready to practice that so i should practice i should come forward i should be with\nour guruji and he have a mission to spread sanatana dharma to the entire make the entire universe\nnoble through filling noble persons how can this possible only through understood realize that\npeople uh come from in front to only if if such people coming in front then only people can\nunderstand lots of women and sisters are there we not only women our ancestors are there who are\nunder clutches of these black religions i would like to call as a black evil we have to save them\nfor that we have to preach what is the real sanatana dharma ideologies as swami vivekananda told\nyears back there should be a time when uh sanatana the ideologies rules and uh philosophies\neverything related to sanatana dharma should reach to the each and every hindus either it be rich\npeople either it would be a poor people that doesn't matter but each and every hindu uh each and\nevery hindu human being's heart should be filled with these ideologies related to sanatana dharma\nphilosophies related to sanatana then only we can say that we are hindus so that should be filled\nfulfilled only through this completing this mission of our acharya so that moment i requested him\nplease accept me as your disciple and i would like to be with you as other disciples with you and i\nshould be i i would i i like to be a shadow of you likewise i requested him he objected a lot he\ndon't know it is not supposed uh it is not a good path to a woman like a girl like you there are\nlots of opportunities waiting for you you are educated you you may get a good salary basic job you\nare you have experience like a teacher you can go out you can live with your parents likewise he uh\nadvised a lot he suggested a lot maybe uh yeah uh what what should i say he was testing my about my\ndecision maybe i don't know uh still now but whatever he said he told me you you have future you go\nwith your parents uh lots of proposals will come you can marry you can live like others you go\nlikewise say advice but i was not in a such a mind that i need a marriage i should live with my\nhusband and children everyone thinks like that no nobody is thinking like this nobody's thinking uh\nto spare their life for others so i decided that time that all advices came towards me like boosting\nmy decision i told him no i don't want any marriage i don't want to leave such a leaf i would i\nwould like to be a shadow just like other disciples are shadows to you i would like to be with you\nto fulfill your mission i would be i would like to be a full-time uh worker here in ashwithya so\nfrom then onwards i am here it is happening 80 years and i am happy and content yeah thank you so so\nmuch rupees that uh thanks so much for sharing that very personal journey uh so it's really really\ncommendable that you've uh so you've always been a seeker right and we can see that there was a void\nin our faith so you had you always had questions and because of lack of answers you had to and you\nyou were at that time seeking answers and then wherever you at that point found some answers you\nmoved to that state so i think you're doing a very important mission of you know providing those\nanswers to seekers right now through our shaviya samajam and helping people understand and know\nabout uh our dharma in general so thank you very much for sharing your story uh so uh we'll uh i'll\nlet's move to anaka and we'll come back to you uh would you uh we'd love to know how your journey\nhappened out of the dharma and back into it as well uh thank you infinity foundation for giving us\nan opportunity to share our experiences uh i am from trishur kerala i was born into an orthodox\nbrahman family from the very young age itself i grew up seeing a lot of rituals that doesn't make\nany senses to me whenever i questioned about this my parents used to say that just because our\nancestors had done this we are also following the same obviously i was not satisfied with their\nanswers i completed my school days from a convent school hence i grew up with the misconception that\nall religions are one after that i did my higher secondary studies in a government school there i\ncame to know that during fridays all government schools offer muslim students an extra one hour for\ntheir jumannamas i was still wonder why this kind of a bias even from a government's goal i thought\nthat there should be something special in this religion and i i had a curiosity to know more about\nit i also noticed that my muslim friends had a good knowledge and strong commitment to their\nreligion so i tried to know more about islam at that time i hadn't any intention to convert islamic\nideology influenced me strongly during my college days i still studied physiotherapy from\narunachalam i was staying there in a hostel and most of my roommates were muslims during casual and\nformal conversations religion also became our topic they asked me many questions for which honestly\ni don't have answers like why do you have so many gods why are you worshiping storms and idols why\nganapathi is having elephant's head is human hanuman is hanuman a monkey so and so i got confused\nand i asked these questions to my parents and relatives but i didn't get any satisfying answers so i\nstarted to study more about hinduism from internet the videos i watched had contents like atma\nparamatma brahma which was beyond my grasp i couldn't see any sources in the internet which gives us\na satisfying answers about hinduism slowly i came to the conclusion that there is nothing right in\nhinduism at the same time my friend started to share the ideology of islam this said it was the\nreligion of peace and muhammad is the last prophet and only guide for the whole humanity they\nboasted about their holy book the quran that it is 1400 years old and it has lots of scientific\nfacts which the world is realizing now no one had the power to change it that it will be protected\nby allah till the end of the world they also shared me the videos of shakin like emma mugman etc to\nslowly convert me to islam they also introduced me about the heaven and hell and also the idea of\ncovering my body and head they told that woman should not expose themselves in front of men their\nbeauty should only be seen by their husbands otherwise allah will punish them so at the end of four\nyears i was totally brainwashed and i decided that i definitely will convert and then the\nenvironment where i walked was also favorable for my islamic studies and also practicing prayers and\nall to some of my close patients when i revealed the idea of converting they seem to be very happy\nand they also promised me all kind of help they offered me financial help and even some of them even\ntold they are ready to marry me the fear of torments of hell increased day by day and after two\nyears of my career life i decided to convert i resent from my job and went to my home i told my\nparents and sisters that i'm going to convert i even tried to convert my little sister and my\nparents and sisters were shocked to see the change in my behavior and dressing it was actually the\nworst six months of my life i changed completely i started to do numbers in my home i got irritated\nwhenever i missed my numbers i stopped singing dancing watching movies hearing songs even i forgot\nto smile i was afraid of everything that even if i do a small mistake allah is going to punish me\ncruelly some of the hindu activists came to know this and they connected my parents with ashvidhya\nsaramaja and thus i came to worship their samara with my sisters first two day teachers of\nashvidesham spoke with me i understood the foolish theory of islam to a certain extent but was not\ncompletely satisfied and on the third of the day acharya shri kian manoji founder and director of de\nsamajana directly spoke with me with valid proof from the quran and hadees on that day i realized\nhow dangerous is the concept of islam and the glory of hindu dharma and the day itself i decided to\ndedicate my own life for sanadana dharma and became the full-timer of arshwa dhyasa mahajan only by\ncoming to ashwider samajam and meeting ajariji i realized my mistake i was amazed with the knowledge\najariji had in this in each subject through his knowledge and observational research ajarji created\na syllabus for the study of sanadana dharma which is simple as that a small child about five years\nalso can understand the concept and uh after that i realized the greatness of this uh mission of\nashville samajam to spread the sanatana dharma all over the world and i dedicated my life to fulfill\najahraji's mission thank you so much so how did your family uh react when you converted was there\nany opposition like how did you handle that actually they were broken and my parents were at the\nwardrobes we said they cried in front of me that please don't go away that if i go they will uh\nsurely they will do suicide but their words and tears uh doesn't even change my decision i said this\nis the right path this uh this is the path that everyone should follow if you are not following this\ni'm not responsible for your faith i was a demon in my decision and nothing could change me that too\nuh that was actually intolerant to my parents and they were broken completely so uh how long were\nyou in the islamic faith how long were you actually i have been studying about islam for the five\nyears and for the last one year after signing my job i was in home and that time i was completely\nliving as a muslim woman like my dressing was changed i was wearing hijab i was doing namas and i\ncompletely avoided hearing songs tvs watching movies i was a dancer i completely dropped dancing\nsinging everything i was completely living like a ideal islamic woman so what was it that actually\nkind of triggered you to start coming back or was there an event or what was it that made you want\nto listen to guruji at abs uh actually uh while i was uh stepping out of my home to uh that is uh\ncoming to ashwajim before uh coming to australia i told my parents that after i get out from\nasheville either i will be complete hindu or a complete muslim i can't live in between that so uh\nand i also said that i'm ready to accept the truth i have no problem to accept the truth whatever\nbut it should be uh logical and it should satisfy my questions that was only condition i uh applied\nbefore coming to australia so when i came here uh first of all uh aji talked to me about quran and\nhadees uh he explained about muhammad prophet muhammad and his deeds everything and i understood the\nillogical things and scientific facts everything in the quran i accepted but still i have so many\ndoubts about sanatana even i asked them and i got very satisfying logical answers from ajariji and\nslowly uh he told that why archevis is functioning and he told that uh is uh functioning uh or it is\nuh mainly to spread the sanadana dharma all over the world it is the mission of our s and i\nunderstood that it is this how much important in this world that that sanatana dharma should exist\nand i uh became the part of uh ashrae de samajam and i want to dedicate my own life to ajariji to\nfulfill his mission thank you so uh do you know of any other uh a person that was converted like is\nthis a real issue do you think it's very uh widely spread uh actually uh before coming to our chevy\nde samajam uh i thought it is not not much serious issue because every indian citizen have the right\nto choose the right decision right so i uh i didn't think that it uh is a serious issue but after\ncoming to arshad savage i understood that conversion is undoubtedly a serious issue to be more\nprecise conversion to semantic religion is definitely a serious issue the separatist movements in\nthe northeastern states of india the condition of pakistan afghanistan bangladesh which were once a\npart of us are proof to this once someone has converted the language of logic humanity science etc\nbecomes irrelevant to them what muhammad made forbidden is unlawful to them and what muhammad made\npermissible is halal or lawful to them they have no other metric if muhammad had done something then\nthey have no hesitation to follow his example unfortunately muhammad has such a very bad example\nthis is clearly indicated in the quran hadees seerah tariquel islam and other authentic texts of\nislam and the history and the current day happenings are also evidence to this that is why uh\ntsunami vegan had rightly said that conversion of a person into any semitic religion is not just\nlaws of one person but the generation of an enemy itself and um we have seen so many cases of\nconversion that lead to extremism and terrorism and how the converting turns against not just his\nfamily but against the society culture dharma and the nation itself and becomes intolerant that is\nuh that's a very interesting point so i have a lot of friends that are muslims but i i don't find\nthem being so against hinduism or anything but like you mentioned people who get converted become\nmore radical do you know why that is like have you observed that as well [Music] actually uh the\nthing i want to say that is if a muslim is be behaving good to you good to other religion people\nthen he had uh he hadn't studied quran perfectly an ideal muslim can't be tolerant to other religion\nbecause an ideal muslim is the one who follows everything each and everything what muhammad does\nwhat uh muhammad this and so if they are following what muhammad does they can't be tolerant to\nother religion i'm saying that if you are friends that that are good to you they are not reading\nquran or they are not following quran perfectly that's why so uh based on your experience how and\nwhere does conversion happen see christians have sunday schools and they also have systematic\ncourses to teach their religion and also muslims have madrasas where they are uh properly teaching\ntheir students about their religion but uh when we come to hinduism we can say that we are not\nhaving any systematic syllabus or systematic courses to uh teach our students about what hinduism is\nor a real sanatana dharma is that is the main problem we are facing uh from my experience i can say\nthat only because of the uh unawareness of my religion my sanadana dharma is the only thing that led\nme to the study of islam or to the conversion that's a great point uh mainly because of lack of\nanswers in our own religion we start looking outside and however false the answers might be on the\nin the other region at least there is some answers that they provide and uh this becomes a way for\npeople to you know get converted as well yeah thank you so much it was very insightful i'm very\nhappy to introduce the vishali shetty vishali shetty was once an agnostic who was drawn strongly\ntowards islam vishali returned to sanatana dharma through aashiviti samajam having been convinced of\nthe magnitude of the mission that vidya samajam has undertaken she chose to be a sanatana dharma\npracharika with abs with her prior experience in it she drives the technical and marketing\nactivities of abs welcome vishali thank you thank you dpg so give us a little bit about your\nbackground uh how and when uh did you get inspired to join abs um yeah so since you spoke in detail\nabout their experiences and my experiences to my experience too is on the same line so let me tell\nyou very briefly i was born in a so called uppercast hindu family with a deep rss background and\nlike all hindu families in general i grew up without any systematic education about my dharma i was\na hindu because i was born into the family i didn't know what it meant uh i saw customs and itself\nall around me and if i asked my parents the significance of them they didn't have answers to it uh\nthey said that it has been followed throughout the generations and we have to follow them i found\nmany customs unnecessary like making huge offerings to deities and all that and uh school days\nduring my school day since my friends were from diverse hindu cultures and not very practicing\nthemselves i grew up to be an agnostic and by the time i had reached college i had started\nquestioning and seeking an absolute answer surprisingly i observed that in college the muslims and\nchristians grew more radical day by day usually we think that the more educated you are the less\nreligious or more less radical you become and you become more progressive but on the contrary uh\nwhat i noticed that in my college probably it's the case with many colleges but in my college itself\nchristians and muslims grew more radical day by day those who had who used to dress very\nprogressively during the start of college had started covering themselves in hijabs and workers by\nthe end of college and they started discussing religion with their classmates and friends and they\nstarted being more more disciplined about their prayers friday prayers etc uh if we had uh any uh\nmany of our muslim classmates took time off on fridays a certain time off on fridays to go to a\nnearby mosque and pray and they had an excuse for that so all this was happening in during my\ncollege and since i always had a spiritual longing once i completed engineering i uh went on to work\nin an iit company and most of my immediate colleagues were muslims so since i had questions in mind\nand through uh in the course of my discussions with with them i uh started to get answers from them\nuh i mean started to get answers from them which seemed to suit my questions seem to sort what i was\nlooking for in the way they presented it it is not right but the way they presented it seemed to\nsuit what i was looking for like in islam they say there's only one god the customs are uniform\nwherever you go in the world the customs are universal throughout the world and all that so that\nseemed to uh convince me a lot and i started uh getting drawn towards islam slowly during my uh\nworking days and that's how my inclination into islam happened and i wanted to learn it in more\ndetail and uh i had started following uh i mean i'd started becoming a little anti-hindu at my home\nit was noticeable uh i started avoiding praying at home avoiding praying before uh idol at home and\nthings like that so eventually i got in touch with asha vidya samajam and once i spoke to uh acharya\nshrikiya manoji he was able to give me convincing answers to all the questions that i was looking\nfor and what seemed to be right about islam uh were what you see were those baseless arguments he\nwas able to uh you know dissect and in and show that they are false they are not what they are uh\npresented to be uh very nice yeah so all those fallacies that i believed about islam to be true were\nbroken once i uh came to ashwaviya samajam and i was convinced uh that what i had believed in so far\nabout islam was wrong and i started studying about sanatana dharma and that's how i came back to\nsanatana dharma through asha vidya thank you so much for sharing that uh so let's uh dive into some\nof the current affairs uh you must have heard of the recent conversion bill that's been discussed in\nkarnataka and also other parts of india do you think this next year what do you think about it is\nthere a need for such a bill uh the anti-conversion bill uh is necessary we don't say that it's not\nnecessary but i think uh the bill might to a small extent make the conversion forces a little\nvigilant but it could also discourage conversions achieved through money and other adornments but\nwhat we think is the brainwashing strategies are very intense and deep and most of the conversions\nthese days are more intellectual and ideological which are achieved through brainwashing and if we\ndon't adopt a counter stand to it what we can call as deep brainwashing or anti-indoctrination the\nbill will not do much good not just that if this bill is passed then all steps taken to bring back\nour brothers and sisters who have converted from hindu dharma into other religions also could be\nseen in a bad light right we can't bring back people who have converted from hindu dharma into islam\nor christianity so we are not sure what provisions the bill has for that though and the vested\ninterest could easily claim that reconversion into sanatana dharma is illegal so in such a situation\nwe won't be able to rescue our people who got trapped due to religious conversion so we are a little\nuncertain as to how effectively this bill can help in fighting conversions that are achieved through\nbrainwashing and through love trap the only long-lasting solution is to have the right awareness\nabout these religions and about sanatana dharma that is very well said it's a double-edged sword\nright so i think the best long-term solution uh would be to educate and make our people aware of the\nthe real depth of the dharma itself which is what you are doing yes okay not just learning about\nsanatana dharma we have to study about other religions also only then we'll be able to bring back\ndoing a comparative study of all religions without a biased mind a very objective example of all\nreligions is essential uh especially like that crucial age where people are asking questions and uh\nthey want some cancer i think that is the right age group that we could use yeah it has to start as\nearly as about four or five years of age because if you see christians or muslims they start\ningraining their ideology from a very tender age say three three and a half years they have their\nmadrasahs in sunday schools which uh impart systematic knowledge about their religions right or\nwrong that is a different question but they have knowledge about their religion and by the time they\nturn uh adolescence or by the time they reach high school or college they are they stand firm by\nwhat they believe in very true uh so how is abs helping with this uh help us understand what are all\nthe different uh means in which you are trying to uh educate yeah so at arsha vidya samajam we have\nadopted an ideological approach which is based on bhartiya taraka sastra we engage the individual in\nquestion in debates we engage the individual in debates based on the religious ideology they believe\nin or have converted into so say suppose somebody is converting into islam or has converted into\nislam the debate with them is based on the quran and the hadiths i mean the authentic scriptures put\nforward by islam so these are these debates are based on the arguments put forward by these\nrespective religions or ideologies and their authentic religious books we disprove their claims\nusing the intellect and ishwara buddhi that god has naturally gifted all of us with we give them an\ninsight into the histories and background of these ideologies and through this itself they'll\nrealize the rights and wrongs of what they believe in this is called comparative religion we dissect\nother religions unbiasedly just like dpg said just now not based on the claims of its followers or\nruthless critics but from the text that they themselves claim to be authentic that is using which is\nuh accept what is right and reject what is not right that's how we guide them back and then we teach\nthem sanatana dharma and in order to unmask their fallacies a very extensive study and research is\nnecessary that's what ashaviya samajam does so is this uh do you have times with schools or how do\nyou actually spread this message right now we are an independent institution uh we are based in\ntrivandrum we have for the past we were we established in 1999 and for the past more than 22 years\nwe've been functioning out of rented premises we don't have a center of our own so we are\nfunctioning from the limits of these premises we had we have courses on different levels which we\noffer for students who come here to study but after the corona situation we have been providing\nthese quotes online and offline also so we conduct camps courses etc but we are planning to do it\nmore extensively by uh making more courses available for people throughout the world in different\nlanguages yeah so vishali uh everyone that we spoke to today uh shruti anaka and you have all uh\nreconverted from islam back to sanatana dharma do you have any uh estimate about christianity like\nthat christianity also is an equally proselytizing religion so what is the percentage of people or\ngirls that have converted to christianity and back uh the pg although the rate of conversions into\nchristianity is higher in the neighboring states like tamilnadu but throughout kerala christianity\nhas created a benign reputation about itself that is they have generated many crypto christians out\nof hindus through their various service activities like hospitals their convent education etc which\nmeans such people still have hindu names but they are christians they basically living as christians\nthey call themselves christians and they have the christian missionaries have brought in a\nsignificant shift in many hindus that they uh have started now visiting churches instead of temples\nlike uh instead of hindus visit churches instead of temples it has become so common now and another\nstriking fact is that in most of these conversions into christianity the whole family itself\nconverts so see if one member any one member from a family converts others from the family will want\nto try to bring them back but if the whole family converts there's nobody to bring them back there's\nnobody attempting to bring them back so that is the case that is what happens with christianity so\nyet we have been able to bring back more than 500 people in all our in our experience so far who had\nconverted into christianity and two of them are our full-time pracharikas now one of them is shanti\nkrishna she has written a book describing her experience of converting into christianity and how she\nreturned to sanatana dharma through asha vidyasamajam this is her book it's titled reborn and we\nhave do it with many such cases and most of them were highly educated and from affluent families we\nhad doctors engineers scientists teachers many such people who converted to christianity so the\npoint here is christians are attempting mass conversion in fact they are converting more vigorously\nthan the muslims are and when whole families convert it is difficult to bring them back so in order\nto overcome this we have to create an organizational network reaching up to the grassroot levels so\nas to be able to reach every home and bring back families who convert in mosque i think that's the\nonly way we can prevent christian conversion so if you look at the conversion demographics uh the\nsouth is definitely more converted to abrahamic religions than the north despite the region being\nrelatively safe from invasions in the past millennia so what do you think accounts for this why are\nthe hindus in the north not converting at the same rate than the ones in the south uh we can't say\nthat uh conversion rate in uh north is not as much as in the south because we shouldn't forget that\nthe north has faced a lot of conversions the formation of afghanistan pakistan bangladesh itself is\na result of religious conversions right a huge part of north india was lost due to conversions and\neven today we are starting to lose parts of northeast india due to religious conversions in many\nrural areas of the north christian missionaries are actively converting people by associating with\nthe naxal groups so it would be unjust to say that north is relatively safe from conversions uh not\nbefore too late the north is also heading towards a great stock but of course since the hindus in\nthe north are in general more aware and since there are several states whose governments are\nfavorable to hindus the conversion forces haven't been able to intensify their activities in the\npresent scenario because uh both due to the central land their state government and the atmosphere\nof partition and symbols of muslim invasions can be seen in the villages of north india even now so\nthey're still uh vigilant and they're still aware hence they haven't been able to grow their power\nthat's what we can say uh coming to the south the states of kerala tamil nadu andhra pradesh and\ntelangana in particular haven't come to the national forefront they are in opposition with the\nnational mainstream and the christian missionaries and caste politics have played a huge role in\nthis that is creating a separatism between the center and the state so uh and hindutva is yet to\nreach these states and its real hindutwise yet to reach these states they have faced the harmful\nconsequences of conservatism and caste supremacy also these southern states especially kerala tamil\nnadu andhra and telangana and uh yeah similarly naxalism communism atheism have distanced people\nfrom blending with the national mainstream but we have to remember that when the north was facing\nthe dire consequences of conversions it was the south that showed the right way that is the\nrevolution led by israel originated from the south the shiva siddhars who had taken proactive steps\nto overcome the influence of jainism and christianity the siddhas of tamil nadu who were successful\nin converting even the christian missionaries into hindu dharma but sadly today due to lack of\nknowledge about our rich history and hindu awareness missionaries are able to easily convert hindus\nand the only permanent solution is to create the right awareness amongst our people and organize\nthem very true so cast for better or worse is a lived reality in india so do you know if conversions\nare happening within specific varnas or jatis if so why uh conversions are not probably in the olden\ndays it might have been but uh see jaati it's a social reality you can't uh escape that right now it\nhas its advantages and disadvantages but it is high every time we get rid of discrimination based on\ncaste supremacy and feelings of caste inequality because it has always been detrimental that it has\nalways been detrimental to us however uh the unity of certain caste based associations is helping\nand resisting religious conversions to a certain extent some religious some caste based associations\nare helping to a certain extent but religious conversions are to be overcome through the right\nawareness about sanatana dharma but since such a changes still make still making a beginning at\nleast until then these associations are often often able to prevent their people from converting\ninto other religions which is a good thing but this is uh this shouldn't be misused beyond a certain\nextent we have to bring in unity based on caste and which i mean we have to bring in unity beyond\ncaste and which is based on ishira guru parampara and sanatana now coming to the trend of conversion\npeople who are getting converted are not from any particular everyone is equally vulnerable\nirrespective of whether they belong to so called uppercase or lowercast not just dhati conversions\nare taking place regardless of educational background profession regardless of everything basically\nanybody is equally vulnerable to conversion these states these days it has reached such an alarming\nstage now that's uh that's very true i had a very curious question like have you seen conversions\nhappen between islam and christianity like a muslim converting to a christian faith or the vice\nversa we have we have seen cases of christians converting into islam you might know the case of\nsonia sebastian from kerala who converted into islam and she eventually joined the is she is now in\nthe is that is the case of conversion from christianity to islam however conversions are happening\nbetween all religions say hinduism to islam islam to christianity christianity to islam between\nbasically between all religions but the uh proportion of it is very less the highest number of\nconversions is from hinduism into other religions yeah because i think uh like you mentioned uh\nhindus are low hanging fruit uh because we ours are so usually connected to our faith we don't know\nwhere to go for answers and uh that makes it uh yeah very easy for us to you know get drawn to other\nfaiths as well so thank you so much the difference is very huge yeah very clear difference is very\nhuge and also i think uh do you think there is also an element of like political power involved like\nuh if someone were to try to convert out of one of the abrahamic faiths into another abrahamic faith\nuh there would also be some political power at play that would prevent it or do you think that not\njust political yeah not just political power their religious system itself prevents somebody from\nconverting into another religion for example in islam they have strict uh they have they have a\nstrict uh role that no i mean there is a concept that anybody who leaves islam or somebody who\nconverts out of out of islam is called a murder and murder can be killed anywhere and any means can\nbe used to kill them so anybody who abandons his faith uh is no i mean anybody who becomes non-\nmuslim should be killed and that uh fear of being killed that fear of being oppressed by his society\nor his uh people keeps people from converting out of islam versus we don't have anything like that\nright that and that i think by nature shows the open and accepting nature of sanatana right right\nthank you so much vishali this was very very informative and uh thank you so much for sharing your\nexperiences and also what ashvidyan samajam is doing uh so let me move to shruti now shruti i know\nthat you had mentioned you've written a book about your experiences could you tell us a little bit\nmore about what motivated you to write this book and a little bit about the book itself the whole\nexperience of mine is explained in the book and when i converted to islam i was having what i say i\nwas hate i was having hatred towards my uh mother religion our hindu dharma sanatana and uh i was\nhaving hatred towards our country our nation and uh i i told you that earlier when they were\nteaching me at purnani uh that this is not our land this is the land of hindu people likewise they\ntaught uh it increased and i i was thinking to move away from our nation and i was having very uh\nwhat i say uh hated towards our culture and the uh cultural heritage of our bharat likewise all\nthese came to uh all these hatred and angry and uh intolerance every every negative approach towards\nour nation our culture our history and our um dharma everything came to me and attacked my mind and\nbrain just because of the ideology which is caught me right so there are lots of people under\nclutches of these islamic ideologies or semitic ideologies and standing against to their uh family\nstanding against to the nation standing against to the ideologies philosophy of everything uh what\num origin here in our bharat and what or what all things are related to bharat and the culture of it\nand what is all things related to dharma of people who convert to semitic religions all of a sudden\nchanging their attitude and becoming uh arrogant enemies to all these things why all these things\nhappening all of a sudden that should be known to all people that all people should understand this\nis not a people in islam or people in christianity who makes ham to the society it is the ideology\nwhich harm the human being i won't blame any isis terrorist i won't blame any taliban people because\nall these taribanis and all these isis people are under clutches and all are brainwashed by all\nthese ideologies so this ideology is the wrong one and nobody is supposed to accept that for that\nwhat we should do we should expose what is the reality why all this conversion and everything\nhappening because people don't know what is the real islamist and what is real sanatana dharma in\nother side why our sanatana dharma is eternal and what is the real uh ideologies and philosophies\nand concept of god concept of life in our sanatana dharma that should be known to all people and\nwhat our ancestors our riship emperors did in our bharat how they could achieve to achieve success\nin spreading sanatana dharma and how how we are living in bharat like hindus very safely because of\ntheir bravery and because of their hard work all these things all these history all these\nphilosophies everything every people should know so for that experienced fellow should come in front\nso this inspired me and i thought to explain i thought to tell my story to the entire world so only\ni wrote uh this book i was having guilty uh i told you know why while i was following islam what\nwhat all things i was doing uh spitting in front of temple courtyard beating my mother and lots of\nlots of things against our dharma he was a very uh bad way interpreting shiva linga's shiva linga\nand other idols in our hindu dharma so i have to do i had a repentance in my mind so i have to do\nsomething to my society i have to do something to my dharma i did wrong i have to correct i i should\nwork in a correct path my guruji showed me a right path rightwards path i have to do something right\nto us to others i realized the truth and i should make others to realize i should help them they\nalso had they why all these conversations are happening just because we are unaware about our\ndarshanas we are unaware about our histories we are making role models we are learning histories\nlike alexander the great in history in school education college education we are learning alexander\nthe great how he became great he is he is from outside india there is no people there is no man in\nindia who are who are qualified deserve to be called as heroes we are uh calling watch superman and\nspiderman like movies why don't we make them watch panipath and and why why don't we uh make them\nwatch real heroes of our bharat lots of heroes are there why don't we make uh teach our children uh\nto make rani patmini rani janshi rani to make their role models they were glorious brave warriors we\nhave to teach them no so what should we do we should expose the reality what is the real face of the\nreligion of peace so called peaceful religion and there is no peace at all and what is reality\nregarding sanatana dharma this all things are misinterpreted and this is the truth that we have to\nsay for that experienced ones you should confront so this inspired me and so i wrote my book story\nof reversion thank you thank you so much i think everyone should read this book uh to understand and\nthis book comes from experience so it's not just theoretical uh by reading so you've actually\npracticed both the fates so thank you so much for uh yeah i i explained how i could convert to islam\nand hi how i could come back to sanatana dharma i was getting all the answers for the questions i\nwas having since i don't know so all those questions got answered and that whole thing i explained\nin this narrated in this so both side is there very nice thank you [Music] you",
    "summary": "Religious conversions are not new to india people have converted from sanatana dharma to other\nfaiths for a multitude of reasons may be monetary sometimes due to lack of answers in their own\nfaith. In today's interview we'll talk to three lovely women who have traveled the full circle to\nunderstand their journey through other faiths. Aarsha vidya samajam is an organization based in\ntirunanthapuram with a very important mission of educating people about sanatana dharma. Shruti is\nthe first woman pracharika at the organization dedicating her life to the mission. Vishali shetty\nwas once an agnostic and she turned into an islamic sympathizer and she returned to sanatan dharma\nthrough this organization. Aarsviya samajan has been convinced of the magnitude of the mission that\nthe samajam has undertaken. She chose to be a sanatan dharma pacharika with abs with her prior\nexperience in it. She drives the technical and marketing activities at abs. Since childhood itself i\nheard a questioning minding me and i used to ask elder people what is the science behind it.\nUnfortunately as brahmin caste is full of restrictions towards the women why i don't know uh why\npeople are restricting such things from women. i had to experience such restrictions my father was\nsaying no women are not have the right to a question like this. \"My parents and the elders were uh\nare in the opinion that uh ladies or women are not supposed to question\" \"I got a fear in my mind to\nask questions because these restrictions uh these objections everything and scalding also i was\ngetting so i stopped asking the questions\" \"Because their elders didn't teach them so they they they\nalso in same situation what i'm experiencing\" In hinduism we can call any woman. called as mother\nwhy shri paramishra is not called as father he is called just like prabhu why it is so so i got an\nanswer from my elders that in hinduist. we can calls any woman mother but we can't call any uh male\nor any gentleman as father. We can call only one person as father uh that is what i that is the\nconservative thought i got. \"i am ign ignorant about all these things i couldn't answer properly so\nuh it generated a type of inferiority complex in me and anyhow i try to ignore ignore their\nquestions ignore them but i could ignore only people the questions which uh all they asked uh were\nin my mind so the questions i had since childhood again came to my mind\"  began to haunt me uh\ngradually i i i could i was thinking that i am not getting any answer for all these questions. i was\nnot a person uh believing in lots of uh so many goals i was believing in a single god. i never uh i\nnever believed in a god. \"I felt that in its uh that single god's name is allah or any other name\nbut i i was in such a view that there is only one god and other my uh my my viewpoint on women was\nvery high\" \"I thought this is the final uh this this should be the final decision\" \"i should follow\nstrictly what muhammad done in his lifetime\" i joined in panani manutel islam sabha eight years back\nand it is in malapram district it is also called as mini mecca and i went underwent two months\ncourse the islam course. i came to know that if my namas and rosa should be accepted uh i should\naccept islam legally. \"I have to preach islam till my last breathe i have to convert my parents my\nentire family likewise my mission was that time i decided to live like that so to for islam,\" she\nsays. \"I was ready to do anything if I have to kill a person if he is against islam i am\" \"My\nparents situation was very pathetic if i didn't say that for just for two days i will go with my\nparents my parents would have died that moment itself\" \"If i if i said something against that that i\ni now itself i have to go to punani again my father would have drunk that person and i would have\nlost my parents\" In an earlier birth i could say that for just for two days i will go with my\nparents that two days changed my life they took me to uh an astrologist from uh from him they got an\nadvice that make her vomit and some drinks they gave me some medicinal drinks i drunk i vomited but\nthe con the ideologies which is uh what influenced my mind kept on there itself something by what i\nate at the morning time that went out that much. Only they thought that some black magic happened on\nme uh to the viewers and to the all eyes i would like to \"He is a great personality he could bring\nthat lot of people uh he could change lots of people's life and he have such power and likewise they\nwere interpreting him\" \"I told him don't call me as shruti call me like rahmat it is my name and i\naccepted islam and i i would like to speak with you only based on quran only\" All these things are\nharam to me i don't want to listen about that i would like to speak about uh quran only that is what\ni said that time with the very not like this but very arrogantly very patiently very calmly he\nsmilingly he told okay. \"As a human being you think not like a blind believer of islam\" \"I was\nfeeling and my my ego was not agreeing to not allowing me to agree what acharya is saying i tried to\nargue with him but uh he again\" \"I was having a respect to respect towards women and the woman is\npictured in a different way in a in a what i what is what i say in a downtrodden way\" One by one\nverses he made me read and i could realize what wrong i did during my islamic belief and all was i i\ngot influenced to islam. i done a lot of uh bad deeds towards hinduism. i scolded once my mother i\nbeaten my mother once just because she is coffer and i don't want to eat food from kafir's hand.\nDuring that time when islamic beliefs was undergoing that that time during that time later when i\nrealized that all these things i did just for this fake uh inhuman religion it was very uh pathetic\nmy situation that time if i say the uh only because of my our guruji come back to life just for a\nmoment i thought to suicide also if i went to my home into my native place that time i would have\ndone suicide at least or else i am a sinful person now. \"Why should i change my decision of\npreaching truth to the people?\" \"There are lots of women lots of people are uh day by day converting\nto such really such fake religions why should i allow them\" \"I should be with our guruji and he have\na mission to\" \"Why should I learn vasudeva if i am not ready to practice that?\" \" spread sanatana\ndharma to the entire make the entire universe noble through filling noble persons how can this\npossible only through understood realize that people uh come from in front to only if if such people\ncoming in front then only people can understand lots of women and sisters are there\" \"I requested\nhim please accept me as your disciple and i would like to be with you as other disciples with you\nand i should be\" \"He objected a lot he don't know it is not supposed uh it's not a good path to a\nwoman like a girl like you\" \"Lots of proposals will come you can marry you can live like others you\ngo\" With my husband and children everyone thinks like that no nobody is thinking like this nobody's\nthinking uh to spare their life for others so i decided that time that all advices came towards me\nlike boosting my decision i told him no i don't want any marriage i don’t want to leave such a leaf\ni would i would like to be a shadow just like other disciples are shadows to you. i was born into an\northodox brahman family from the very young age itself i grew up seeing a lot of rituals that\ndoesn't make any senses to me whenever i questioned about this my parents used to say that just\nbecause our ancestors had done this we are also following the same. moved to that state so i think\nyou're doing a very important mission of you know providing those answers to seekers. During my\nhigher secondary studies in a government school there i came to know that during fridays all\ngovernment schools offer muslim students an extra one hour for their jumannamas. i was still wonder\nwhy this kind of a bias even from a government's goal i thought that there should be something\nspecial in this religion and i i had a curiosity to know more about it. i hadn't any intention to\nconvert islamic ideology influenced me strongly. i got confused and i asked these questions to my\nparents and relatives but i didn't get any satisfying answers so i started to study more about\nhinduism from internet the videos i watched had contents like atma paramatma brahma which was beyond\nmy grasp. slowly i came to the conclusion that there is nothing right in h Hinduism at the same time\nmy friend started to share the ideology of islam this said it was the religion of peace and muhammad\nis the last prophet. The fear of torments of hell increased day by day and after two years of my\ncareer life i decided to convert. the heaven and hell and also the idea of covering my body and head\nthey told that woman should not expose themselves in front of men. their beauty should only be seen\nby their husbands otherwise allah will punish them. \"I was afraid of everything that even if i do a\nsmall mistake allah is going to punish me cruelly some of the hindu activists came to know this and\nthey connected my parents with ashvidhya saramaja and thus i came to worship their samara\" \"On the\nthird of the day acharya shri kian manoji founder and director of de samajana directly spoke with me\nwith valid proof from the quran and hadees on that day i realized how dangerous is the concept of\nislam and Ajariji created a syllabus for the study of sanadana dharma which is simple as that a\nsmall child about five years also can understand the concept. \"i dedicated my life to fulfill\najahraji's mission\" \"This is the path that everyone should follow if you are not following this i'm\"\n\"I have been studying about islam for the five years and for the last one year after signing my job\ni was in home and that time i was completely living as a muslim woman like my dressing was changed i\nwas wearing hijab i was doing namas and i completely avoided hearing songs tvs watching movies\" \"I\nwas a demon in my decision and nothing could change me that too that was actually intolerant to my\nparents and they were broken completely\" i applied before coming to australia. be complete hindu or\na complete muslim i can't live in between that so uh and i also said that i'm ready to accept the\ntruth i have no problem toaccept the truth whatever but it should be uh logical and it should\nsatisfy my questions. i got very satisfying logical answers from ajariji. Before coming to our chevy\nde samajam i thought it is not not much serious issue because every indian citizen have the right to\nchoose the right decision right. After coming to arshad savage i understood that conversion is\nundoubtedly a serious issue. Once someone has converted the language of logic humanity science etc\nbecomes irrelevant to them what muhammad made forbidden is unlawful to them. \"If muhammad had done\nsomething then they have no hesitation to follow his example unfortunately muhammad has such a very\nbad example\" \"Conversion of a person into any semitic religion is not just laws of one person but\nthe generation of an enemy itself\" \"People who get converted become more radical\" An ideal muslim is\nthe one who follows everything each and everything what muhammad does what uh muhammad this and so\nif they are following what mu Muhammad does they can't be tolerant to other religion. i'm saying\nthat if you are friends that that are good to you they are not reading quran or they're not\nfollowing quran perfectly that's why so based on your experience how and where does conversion\nhappen.  vishali shetty was once an agnostic who was drawn strongly towards islam. She returned to\nsanatana dharma through aashiviti samajam. Vishali chose to be a sanatana Dharma pracharika with abs\nwith her prior experience. Vishali was born in a so called uppercast hindu family with a deep rss\nbackground and like all hindu families in general i grew up without any systematic education about\nmy dharma i was a hindu because i was born into the family i didn't know what it meant. i found many\ncustoms unnecessary like making huge offerings to deities and all that and uh school days during my\nschool day. By the time i had reached college i had started questioning and seeking an absolute\nanswer surprisingly i observed that in college the muslims and christians grew more radical day by\nday. Those who had who used to dress very progressively during the start of college had started\ncovering themselves in hijabs and workers by the end of college and they started discussing religion\nwith their classmates and friends. \"i started uh getting drawn towards islam slowly during my uh\nworking days and that's how my inclination into islam happened and i wanted to learn it in more\ndetail\" \"i'd started becoming a little anti-hindu at. happening in during my college and since i\nalways had a spiritual longing once i completed engineering\" \"All those fallacies that i believed\nabout islam to be true were broken once i came to ashwaviya samajam\" \"i started studying about\nsanatana dharma and that's how i came back to sanatana Dharma through asha vidya\" \"I started\navoiding praying at home avoiding praying before uh idol at home and things like that\" Anti-\nconversion bill in Karnataka is necessary. Bill might to a small extent make the conversion forces a\nlittle vigilant but it could also discourage conversions achieved through money and other\nadornments. Most conversions these days are more intellectual and ideological which are achieved\nthrough brainwashing and if we don't adopt a counter stand to it the bill will not do much good.\n\"The vested interest could easily claim that reconversion into sanatana dharma is illegal so in such\na situation we won't be able to rescue our people who got trapped due to religious conversion so we\nare a little uncertain as to how effectively this bill can help in fighting conversions that are\nachieved through brainwashing and through love trap\" i think it has to start as early as about four\nor five years of age because if you see christians or muslims they start ingraining their ideology\nfrom a very tender age. At arsha vidya samajam we have adopted an ideological approach which is\nbased on bhartiya taraka sastra we engage the individual in question in debates.  debates are based\non the arguments put forward by these respective religions or ideologies and their authentic\nreligious books. We disprove their claims using the intellect and ishwara buddhi that god has\nnaturally gifted all of us with. We give them an insight into the histories and background of these\nideologies and through this itself they'll realize the rights and wrongs of what they believe in.\nashaviya samajam is an independent institution based in trivandrum. It was established in 1999 and\nfor the past more than 22 years we've been functioning out of rented premises. After the corona\nsituation we have been providing these quotes online and offline also so we conduct camps courses.\nChristianity also is an equally proselytizing religion so what is the percentage of people or girls\nthat have converted to christianity and back. shruti anaka and you have all uh reconverted from\nislam back to sanatana dharma do you have any uh estimate aboutchristianity like that. More than 500\npeople in all our in our experience so far who had converted into christianity. Two of them are our\nfull-time pracharikas now one of them is shanti krishna. Most of them were highly educated and from\naffluent families. Doctors engineers scientists teachers many such people who converted to.\nChristians are attempting mass conversion in fact they are converting more vigorously than the\nmuslims are. When whole families convert it is difficult to bring them back so in order to overcome\nthis we have to create an organizational network reaching up to the grassroot levels. i think that's\nthe only way we can prevent christian conversion. A huge part of north india was lost due to\nconversions and even today we are starting to lose parts of northeast india due to religious\nconversions in many rural areas of the north christian missionaries are actively converting people\nby associating with the naxal groups. bangladesh itself is a result of religious conversions right.\nThe states of kerala tamil nadu andhra pradesh and telangana in particular haven't come to the\nnational forefront. They are in opposition with the national mainstream and the christian\nmissionaries and caste politics have played a huge role in this. Cast for better or worse is a lived\nreality in india so do you know if conversions are happening within specific varnas or jatis if so.\nconversions are not probably in the olden days it might have been but uh see jaati it's a social\nreality you can't uh escape that right now. Some religious some caste based associations are helping\nto a certain extent but religious conversions are to be overcome through the right awareness about\nsanatana dharma. People who are getting converted are not from any particular everyone is equally\nvulnerable irrespective of whether they belong to so called uppercase or lowercast.  conversion\nthese states these days it has reached such an alarming stage now that's very true i had a very\ncurious question like have you seen conversions happen between islam and christianity like a muslim\nconverting to a christian faith or the vice versa we have we have seen cases of christians\nconverting into islam. Highest number of conversions is from hinduism into other religions. There is\na concept that anybody who leaves islam or somebody who converts out of out of islam is called a\nmurder and murder can be killed anywhere and any means can be used to kill them so anybody who\nabandons his faith should be killed. very easy for us to you know get drawn to other faiths as well\nso thank you so much the difference is very huge. Vishali: When i converted to islam i was having\nwhat i say i was hate. I was having hatred towards my mother religion our hindu dharma sanatana and\n our country our nation. I think by nature shows the open and accepting nature of sanatana right\nright. i was thinking to move away from our nation and i was having very uh what i say uh hated\ntowards our culture and the cultural heritage of our bharat likewise all these came to uh all these\nhatred and angry and uh intolerance every every negative approach towards our nation our culture our\nhistory and our um dharma everything came to me and attacked my mind and brain just because of the\nideology which is caught me right. People should understand this is not a people in islam or people\nin christianity who makes ham to the society. It is the ideology which harm the human being. People\ndon't know what is the real islamist and what is real sanatana dharma in other side. \"I was having\nguilty uh i told you know why while i was following islam what what all things i was doing uh\nspitting in front of temple courtyard beating my mother and lots of lots of things against our\ndharma he was a very uh bad way interpreting shiva linga's shiva Linga and other idols in our hindu\ndharma so i have to do\" There is no man in india who are who are qualified deserve to be called as\nheroes. We are calling watch superman and spiderman like movies. Why don't we make them watch real\nheroes of our bharat lots of heroes are there. We should expose the real face of the religion of\npeace so called peaceful. This is the truth that we have to say for that experienced ones you should\nconfront so this inspired me and so i wrote my book story of reversion. religion and there is no\npeace at all and what is reality regarding sanatana dharma this all things are misinterpreted."
